Echode
====
Echode is a programming language, designed to be simple.

It is still in development, there isn't any download yet. But if you feel adventurous, nab the latest build at jenkins.[![Build Status](http://marksomnian.com:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=Echode)](http://marksomnian.com:8080/job/Echode/)

Echode itself is made in Java. (Don't worry if you don't know what that is)
